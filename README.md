# KucherX

KucherX is a simple user-friendly GUI application designed for configuration, diagnostics,
and maintenance of [Cyphal](https://opencyphal.org/)-enabled Zubax hardware.
It is a tool for:

- Configuration and diagnostics of Cyphal-enabled hardware manufactured by Zubax.
- Visualization of data from Cyphal subjects and registers in real-time (online, on a live network).
- Exporting of the data captured from the live network for offline analysis (using Pandas, PlotJuggler, MATLAB, etc.)

KucherX does not aim to be a general-purpose Cyphal diagnostics tool.
If you need that, consider using [Yakut](https://github.com/OpenCyphal/yakut) instead.

KucherX is compatible with GNU/Linux and Windows.
