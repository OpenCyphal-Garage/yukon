# Initialising an slcan transport with a Myxa connected
The myxa should have a Cyphal capable firmware installed and then it should be connected to the computer using a Babel. Yukon should be opened and a new slcan transport should be created.

The transport should be configured to use the Babel as the interface. All registers of the Myxa should be visible, reread should be possible by holding the alt-key.
